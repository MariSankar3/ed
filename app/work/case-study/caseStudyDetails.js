Our research revealed that the biggest obstacle to their growth was not a lack of tools, but an overabundance of disconnected ones. Their daily operations are typically spread across a mix of spreadsheets, emails, CRMs, and messaging apps. This fragmented approach creates significant problems: scattered data, duplicated work, poor visibility for managers, and critical communication gaps. This pain was especially acute for mobile and field staff, who were often disconnected from the essential tools and real-time updates needed to perform their jobs effectively.`,
